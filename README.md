# Project Title: Visual Data
### Problem Statement
When looking at large amounts of data it is sometimes hard to visualize the big picture of whats really going on. 
Lets pretend that you own a car dealership and want to know what months typically have the largest sales. To find out
the answer to this many years of car sales would need to be analysed. This task would be daunting to accomplish without
the help from some clever software. This is interesting because the concept can be applied to many real life situations
where data needs to analysed and viewed graphically to be understood.  

### Problem Analysis
To accomplish this project many concepts from class will be used together to organize, calculate, and display our data.
- A database will be used to store and organize the data that will be used. 
- Mathmatical procedures will be writting to perform the statistcal computation. 
- The plot library will be used to display the data stored in the database. 
- Other methods will be written to import data from an outside file that will be used to fill database. 

### Data set or other source materials
The data we use will come from a file like a excel sheet we create. This file will simulate the data that could be received 
from other sources like the internet. For building and testing purposes we need the data to be fixed and predictable so that is why 
we decided to create our own data set.

The data will be implemented into a database we create for organization.  

To get an idea of the type of data we should build. We will perform research on car sales to see what kind of information 
is important to consider. 

### Deliverable and Demonstration
Explain exactly what you'll have at the end. What will it be able to do at the live demo?

What exactly will you produce at the end of the project? A piece of software, yes, but what will it do? Here are some questions to think about (and answer depending on your application).

Will it run on some data, like batch mode? Will you present some analytical results of the processing? How can it be re-run on different source data?

Will it be interactive? Can you show it working? This project involves a live demo, so interactivity is good.

### Evaluation of Results
How will you know if you are successful? 
If you include some kind of _quantitative analysis,_ that would be fantastic.

## Work Plan and Schedule
Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product. Write your general plan here. 
There are three deliverable milestones to explicitly define, below. The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc. 

You will be expected to turn in code, documentation, and data (as appropriate) at each of these stages, so take care in writing concrete steps for your schedule. 

In this general plan, and in the deliverables below.

### First Milestone (04-13)
What exactly will be turned in on this day? 

### Second Milestone (04-21)
What exactly will be turned in on this day? 

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

## Proposal Presentations
Create your 2- to 3-slide presentation in [Google Slides][gslides]. Then, import them into one of the two slide decks:

* [Martin section][martinslides]
* [Sherman section][shermanslides]
